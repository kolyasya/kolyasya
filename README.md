## Hi there 👋

Hey, I’m Nikolay — a full-stack developer with 15+ years of experience building web and mobile apps. I mostly work with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js, and I enjoy turning complex ideas into well-built, scalable products.

These days, I lead a small team of senior devs. We take on everything from MVPs to production-grade platforms — dashboards, SaaS apps, AI integrations, automation tools, you name it.
